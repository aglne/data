# .gov domains

You can view or download a complete list of `.gov` domains. This list includes the federal government's executive, legislative, and judicial branches -- as well as states, territories, cities, counties, and native tribes.

Note that these files list the domains that have been registered, and include some that redirect to other domains or are inactive.
